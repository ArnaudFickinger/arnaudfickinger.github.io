* I just has a dream about Pierre Rolland still acting like a child at 24. It has made me a strange feeling when I project it on the behavior I have 
sometimes with my parents. Let's respect them and act like an adult.

* The interviewed talk about training the idea machine, by thinking about ideas every day just to train. Even
executing an idea is just a subset of ideas, everything is idea and that is the way to success, with I think self-discipline. I am gonna 
train my self-discipline too.
And bad event might lead you to very good event in the future, so lets forget. And dont ask you why people did that, they just do 
something about themself independently of us. I thought I found a place but today the landlord is not responding to me. I am thanksful to him for
enabling me to work this aspect: I don't ask me why, I just continue my search for another room. It's boring but with more self-discipline
and trust about the future I will go threw it without being. When you are working and you are pissed of, remember that it's always a way to learn and improve
yourself, and be thankful to be paid to learn. You are a very privileged person to be a PhD student in a so interesting topic in one of the best place 
in the world. Don't be a victim of the courses, always be motivated to learn and to fail and to learn more. Not finding a solution is a hint that you didn't understand
something and you can be thankful for that. There is no difficult thing in life, just think you don't understand yet. Don't le you demotivated y something 
you don't understand, take it as a motivation to learn. I need to think about this negative feeling everytime I fight with my girlfriend, and what ush me 
to think about calling her back. I just need to trust her in her own self development, stop thinking about what the other think. Just believe the world
as you observe it.

* Started a weekly planner and calendar instead of to do list. Feeling sick, will be better tmr with good sleep. Started book numerical optimization, will take me more time 
than expected, don't give up, you have to master optimization and statistics. Don't forget your goal: reach Abbeel. Be bold and strong. Work hard. 
* SD: Elon Musk said that he don't think by analogy, but rather try to find the root of the problem and that makes him innovate: do that for your research!
The interviewed [writer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjGqpic7pS4) said that accepting people for who they are is very liberating. More generally, accepting life as it is is liberating.
He seems very interesting, Robert Greene. I had a sincere talk with my girlfriend, what made me aggressive is that she was interrupting me all the time, 
and she was interrupting me because she was feeling unsafe. A calm and sincere talk is always the good solution.

* I am still loosing time on the experiment part. I need to think before implementing. Think of creating global functions that would help 
me to be more productive, like a plotting method. Right now my code is going nowhere, I should always think modular to easily test new ideas.
* SD: I had a misunderstanding with a potential renter because my girlfriend and I gave two different stories to her. The lesson is that, as mentioned
in this [TED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUnRKf2CemA), being honest and authentic is always the good solution. In trying to explain it to my girlfriend,
I noticed that she were getting mad everytime I told her what she should do, and actuallt I would get mad to if someone always say me what I should do. 
I think I always tell her how I would improve the situation or wait that she asks me what she should do. Also I need to put more fun in my conversations, even if
it's a serious one, like when I was smocking. And I understand when she felt like I'm against her to tell her what she did to the renter is not good. I
should always support her and comfort her. As said in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwGFZmlOzhw), accepting before changing. And I won't say I should now, for myself 
or others. I give solution and not advice. A nice technique about productivity seen on this [website](https://www.mayooshin.com/how-to-stop-procrastinating-2-minute-rule/): if a task
take 2 minutes to finish, just do it now, and if a task take longer, cut it into 2 minutes subtasks. I have quited coffee. In this [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc1hCpbkRz4), the
comedian tell that we are just the present, every pain we have is because we think that temporary things are eternal. To alleviate the pain let's enjoy the moment we have
with everyone and keep in mind its temporal. I will identify what gives me dopamine in the following days, this is the key to get my energy.
Of course when I am smoking, but also when i have a good result at work. I will spend every day doing at least one task that I know will get me dopamine. Today,
I will read the paper from Abbeel and relate it to my project, I am sure that if I succeed I will have a lot of dopamine. Following this [article](https://doist.com/blog/high-energy-level/), 
I have started a post where I write my daily gratitude.

* I have spent the day trying to implement the best response to maxirl. I have created an experiment journal, I think I will feel that kind of day more useful with that, it trains me how to communicate about my experiment, it forces me to understand what I do and I will be more productive not trying the same thing twice.
* I have continued to watch Abbeel's lecture. I really think that this format is good (30min) but I should be sure that I don't spend long time to write the post. Ideally, 20 minutes of watching
and 10 minutes of writing.
* SD: The [interviewed businessman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMmOQCf98-k) talked about reading every day a paper where he wrote his goals. I have created the post goals because of that, I think it's always good
to understand his small daily actions as part of a long-term goal. He also gave a concrete technique: if we are not in the powerful state, breath 6 times and AIA: awareness (what i'm thinking), intention (what I want to do), action (small action to handle it).
* Gonna shut down computers at 10 and take melatonin, let's not put any alarm and write down what time I wake up. Tomorrow let's try to not take melatonin anymore.
> Tomorrow, let's continue the experiment on MACIRL and send to Dylan and Simon (this time for real!) and think about the theory: can we prove a gibbard version for sequential decision-making and observations?
> I should read different versions of the proof of Gibbard. Maybe start with a multi-armed bandit setting. Then, I want to think about my coordination IL project, write a post about it and read Abbeel's article. Then,
>continue the tutorial on openai, implement PPO and make it work for my multi agent environment. Start to think about a post about multiagent systems and the emergence of behaviors.

# April 3, 2020
* I have finally finished my first memo for the Beneficial AI class. It's a good idea to do memos for every lectures, what about publishing memo as posts?
* I have created this website. Let's try to update it daily.
* I have done the homework 9 for the EECS227 class. I should really do one exercise per day, would be more productive I think.
* I have started to watch the deep unsupervised lecture from Abbeel. I think a good method is to watch 30min then put what we think is important in a post.
* Self-Development: The [interviewed neuroscientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0TedFPgH8) told about how we can transform our brain by just imagining success or being surrounded by successful people. 
I should never forget that: being surrounded by other smart PhD students is an advantage. What I am watching and who I am speaking to influence my brain. I should definitely talk to Abbeel.
>Tomorrow, after putting the bag in Yuting's place, finish the MACIRL experiment and send the result to Dylan and Simon
