# April 4, 2020
* I have spent the day trying to implement the best response to maxirl. I have created an experiment journal, I think I will feel that kind of day more useful with that, it trains me how to communicate about my experiment, it forces me to understand what I do and I will be more productive not trying the same thing twice.
* I have continued to watch Abbeel's lecture. I really think that this format is good (30min) but I should be sure that I don't spend long time to write the post. Ideally, 20 minutes of watching
and 10 minutes of writing.
* SD: The [interviewed businessman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMmOQCf98-k) talked about reading every day a paper where he wrote his goals. I have created the post goals because of that, I think it's always good
to understand his small daily actions as part of a long-term goal. He also gave a concrete technique: if we are not in the powerful state, breath 6 times and AIA: awareness (what i'm thinking), intention (what I want to do), action (small action to handle it).
* Gonna shut down computers at 10 and take melatonin, let's not put any alarm and write down what time I wake up. Tomorrow let's try to not take melatonin anymore.
> Tomorrow, let's continue the experiment on MACIRL and send to Dylan and Simon (this time for real!) and think about the theory: can we prove a gibbard version for sequential decision-making and observations?
> I should read different versions of the proof of Gibbard. Maybe start with a multi-armed bandit setting. Then, I want to think about my coordination IL project, write a post about it and read Abbeel's article. Then,
>continue the tutorial on openai, implement PPO and make it work for my multi agent environment. Start to think about a post about multiagent systems and the emergence of behaviors.

* I have finally finished my first memo for the Beneficial AI class. It's a good idea to do memos for every lectures, what about publishing memo as posts?
* I have created this website. Let's try to update it daily.
* I have done the homework 9 for the EECS227 class. I should really do one exercise per day, would be more productive I think.
* I have started to watch the deep unsupervised lecture from Abbeel. I think a good method is to watch 30min then put what we think is important in a post.
* Self-Development: The [interviewed neuroscientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE0TedFPgH8) told about how we can transform our brain by just imagining success or being surrounded by successful people. 
I should never forget that: being surrounded by other smart PhD students is an advantage. What I am watching and who I am speaking to influence my brain. I should definitely talk to Abbeel.
>Tomorrow, after putting the bag in Yuting's place, finish the MACIRL experiment and send the result to Dylan and Simon
