# April 2, 2020

* During the writing of my [memo](/files/memo1.pdf) "Rational Decision-Making for a Group of Individuals" for the [Beneficial AI](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/classes/cs294/s20/announcement.html) class
    * Jakob’s [post](https://jsteinhardt.wordpress.com/2017/02/07/model-mis-specification-and-inverse-reinforcement-learning/) on misspecification and IRL
        * A more general view of mis-specification can be found in a previous [post](https://jsteinhardt.wordpress.com/2017/01/10/latent-variables-and-model-mis-specification/#comments
) 
        * A classical [article](https://leon.bottou.org/publications/pdf/tr-2012-09-12.pdf
) introducing causal inference and applying it to ad biding. Wondering how I can relate causal inference to mechanism design in the case of IRL.
        * Evans’ [book](https://agentmodels.org/) about modelling agents
        * The mentionned issue about the different action spaces leads me to Abbeel's [article](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B16dGcqlx). Can be a good start for the Coordination IRL project.
    * Armstrong's [post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GfMGa9e79AfDMLj36/best-utility-normalisation-method-to-date
) on normalizing utilities. LessWrong has a lot of useful resource to work on human-compatible AI.
        * He wrote an older similar [post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hBJCMWELaW6MxinYW/intertheoretic-utility-comparison)
