# April 4, 2020
* Writing my post on IRL and Gibbard's theorem
    * Rosenfeld's [book](https://www-morganclaypool-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/pdf/10.2200/S00820ED1V01Y201712AIM036) on predicting Human Decision-Making. Other interesting books in the same collection:
        * An [introduction](https://www-morganclaypool-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.2200/S00091ED1V01Y200705AIM002) to multiagent systems
        * An [introduction](https://www-morganclaypool-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.2200/S00108ED1V01Y200802AIM003) to game theory
        * A [book](https://www-morganclaypool-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.2200/S00355ED1V01Y201107AIM016) about cooperative games
        * A [book](https://www-morganclaypool-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.2200/S00372ED1V01Y201107AIM014) about preferences
        * A [book](https://www-morganclaypool-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.2200/S00559ED1V01Y201312AIM027) about aggregation 
        * A [book](https://www-morganclaypool-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.2200/S00568ED1V01Y201402AIM028) about human-robot teaching
        * A [book](https://www-morganclaypool-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.2200/S00564ED1V01Y201311AIM024) about general games
        * A [book](https://www-morganclaypool-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.2200/S00765ED1V01Y201704AIM034) about multi-objective optimization
        * A [book](https://www-morganclaypool-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.2200/S00832ED1V01Y201802AIM037) about lifelong learning
        

# April 3, 2020
* By reading a post on EECS227's Piazza about complementary slackness
    * Vazirani's [book](http://algorithmics.lsi.upc.edu/docs/Dasgupta-Papadimitriou-Vazirani.pdf) on Algorithms.


# April 2, 2020

* During the writing of my [memo](/files/memo1.pdf) "Rational Decision-Making for a Group of Individuals" for the [Beneficial AI](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/classes/cs294/s20/announcement.html) class
    * Jakob’s [post](https://jsteinhardt.wordpress.com/2017/02/07/model-mis-specification-and-inverse-reinforcement-learning/) on misspecification and IRL
        * A more general view of mis-specification can be found in a previous [post](https://jsteinhardt.wordpress.com/2017/01/10/latent-variables-and-model-mis-specification/#comments
) 
        * A classical [article](https://leon.bottou.org/publications/pdf/tr-2012-09-12.pdf
) introducing causal inference and applying it to ad biding. Wondering how I can relate causal inference to mechanism design in the case of IRL.
        * Evans’ [book](https://agentmodels.org/) about modelling agents
        * The mentionned issue about the different action spaces leads me to Abbeel's [article](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B16dGcqlx). Can be a good start for the Coordination IRL project.
    * Armstrong's [post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GfMGa9e79AfDMLj36/best-utility-normalisation-method-to-date
) on normalizing utilities. LessWrong has a lot of useful resource to work on human-compatible AI.
        * He wrote an older similar [post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hBJCMWELaW6MxinYW/intertheoretic-utility-comparison)
