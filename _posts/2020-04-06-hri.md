# Laplace Approximation

To approximate an integral, we can start by a second-order Taylor expansion:

$$f(x) \sim f(x^*) + \nabla f(x^*)^T(x-x^*) + \frac{1}{2}= 

We end up with Gaussian integrals

Legibility and Predictability are different because one normalize over trajectories and the other normalize other goals
so intuitively in one case we think about the other trajectories and in the other case we think about the other goals

* To optimize the legibility, think bout the Newton integral
